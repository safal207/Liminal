1. **Local API Development**: Core FastAPI app working with 29 routes
2. **Configuration Testing**: All settings systems functional  
3. **Database Integration**: Neo4j and Redis drivers available
4. **Real-time Features**: WebSocket infrastructure ready
5. **Monitoring**: Business metrics and health checks working
6. **Resilience**: Circuit breakers and fault tolerance active
