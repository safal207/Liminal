## Summary
Briefly describe the purpose of this RFC and the business or technical outcomes it enables.

## Context
Provide background on the current architecture, known pain points, and drivers for change.

## Goals
- Enumerate the primary objectives (e.g., resilience, scalability, developer productivity).

## Non-Goals
- Clarify what is explicitly out of scope for this RFC.

## Proposed Architecture
Describe the target-state architecture at a high level, highlighting data flow, major components, and integration patterns.

### Configuration Strategy
- Centralized, versioned configuration managed via GitOps pipelines.
- Environment-specific overlays using Hierarchical Configuration Language (HCL) with validation gates in CI.
- Secret management delegated to Vault with short-lived tokens rotated automatically.

### API Modularity
- Decompose monolithic API into domain-aligned microservices with clearly defined contracts.
- Adopt AsyncAPI + OpenAPI specs per service with linting in CI.
- Introduce an API gateway layer enforcing rate limits, auth policies, and schema mediation.

### Dependency Injection (DI)
- Standardize on a framework-level DI container (e.g., FastAPI Depends / Spring Context) for all services.
- Register adapters (persistence, messaging, third-party) as injectable providers with scoped lifetimes.
- Enforce constructor-based injection in business logic modules to improve testability.

### Observability
- Implement OpenTelemetry instrumentation across services (traces, metrics, logs).
- Stream telemetry to a centralized data lake with Grafana dashboards and alerting baselines.
- Establish SLOs per service with error budgets reviewed in weekly ops syncs.

## Detailed Design
Dive into modules, interfaces, data contracts, and sequence diagrams as needed.

## Security Considerations
Outline authentication, authorization, data protection, and compliance impacts.

## Migration Plan
Summarize the phased approach for rolling out the new architecture (reference the migration calendar below).

## Stakeholder Alignment
Document workshop outcomes, decisions, and outstanding questions.

## Risks & Mitigations
List key risks and how they will be mitigated.

## Open Questions
Capture unresolved items requiring follow-up.

## Appendices
Include supporting artifacts (e.g., diagrams, survey results).
