ðŸ§­ðŸ§  Retrosplenial Gateway Layer â€” Brain's Internal Compass

Inspired by neuroscience discovery: Scientists found that the retrosplenial complex (RSC) 
and superior parietal lobule work as the brain's internal compass, maintaining directional 
orientation regardless of environmental changes.

This layer serves as LIMINAL's central navigation system:
- Direction Encoding: Maps events to semantic directions (N/E/S/W of meaning)
- Context Stability: Maintains orientation during transitions
- Memory Compass: Links perception to spatial-temporal memory
- Transition Navigation: Guides movement through liminal states

"Like a blade of grass in the wind that, no matter how it bends, 
 always points to where the sun is." â€” The brain's compass never loses direction.
