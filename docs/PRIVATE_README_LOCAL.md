# PRIVATE README (Local Only)

This file is intentionally kept OUT of Git. It is for your eyes only.

Purpose:
- Hold strategic notes, architecture vision, and sensitive plans which you do not want to publish yet.
- Serve as your personal north star while public README stays concise.

Privacy:
- This path is added to .git/info/exclude so it will not be committed.
- If you clone to a new machine, reâ€‘add the exclude entry (see tip below).

## Gentle Compass (Teacherâ€™s Note)

Let your work be like a lotus: rooted in the mud of reality, yet rising clean and bright. Move softly, step by step. Protect the seed of intention until it is strong enough to bloom in public. ðŸ’—

## Strategic Outline (draft)

- Vision: LIMINAL â€” a system for conscious transitions, resonance, and inner clarity.
- Pillars: Safety, Observability, Scaleâ€‘out, Event History, Philosophyâ€‘inâ€‘code.
- Nearâ€‘term sprints:
  1) Redisâ€‘backed WebSocket scaleâ€‘out; smoke/burst tests (Artillery).
  2) Observability: Prometheus, alerting SLO, dashboards.
  3) CI hardening: unit + integration + load smoke on PR.
  4) Developer onboarding: scripts, docs, quick health panel.

## Sensitive Sections (outline only)

- Architecture Vision (expanded)
  - Security Layer (mTLS, JWT, audit)
  - API Gateway + Rate Limiting
  - Realtime Engine (WS pools, backpressure)
  - ML/Insights lane; Graph model (Neo4j best practices)
  - Message bus (RabbitMQ), patterns & priorities
- RINSE module (deterministic, offlineâ€‘friendly)
  - Input â†’ cleanse â†’ insight â†’ tags â†’ clarity
  - Test strategies and fixtures
- Privacy & Safety
  - Differential privacy budget (Îµ, Î´)
  - Anonymization flows and logging retention
- Roadmap risks and mitigation
  - Vendor lockâ€‘in, cost ceilings, perf/regressions

## Load & CI Notes (private)

- Smoke profile: 10s, arrivalRateâ‰ˆ3â€“5, WS ping/close.
- Optional SLO: p95 < 250ms, errors < 1% (to be tuned per env).
- Artifacts: artillery-results.json for quick triage.
- Local wrapper: scripts/ws-burst.ps1 (ASCIIâ€‘only, Windowsâ€‘friendly).

## Personal Reminders

- Keep public README minimal; let this file carry the deeper map.
- When merging, prefer public README to avoid leaking strategy.
- Reflect weekly: what can safely graduate from here to public docs?

## Quick Tips

- Reâ€‘add exclude on a fresh clone:
  - Append `docs/PRIVATE_README_LOCAL.md` to `.git/info/exclude`.
- Open this file from repo root:
  - Windows: `notepad .\\docs\\PRIVATE_README_LOCAL.md`
  - VS Code: `code docs/PRIVATE_README_LOCAL.md`

Nurture clarity. Protect the seed. When the time is right, the blossom will share its fragrance with the world. ðŸŒ¸
