# Stakeholder Workshop Plan & Outcomes

## Participants
- **Backend:** Lead Architect, API Chapter Representative
- **Machine Learning:** Head of ML Platform, MLOps Engineer
- **DevOps:** SRE Lead, Infrastructure Automation Engineer
- **Documentation:** Technical Writer Lead, Developer Education Advocate

## Workshop Objectives
1. Validate priorities for configuration modernization, modular API rollout, DI standardization, and observability uplift.
2. Identify cross-team dependencies and assign accountable owners.
3. Align on success criteria and metrics for each initiative.

## Pre-Work
- Distribute RFC draft and collect asynchronous feedback 3 days prior.
- Compile current-state telemetry gaps and configuration pain points.
- Prepare service inventory and dependency graphs.

## Agenda (3 hours)
1. **Kick-off & Goals (15 min)** — Review modernization vision and scope.
2. **Deep Dive: Configuration & Secrets (35 min)** — Decide on GitOps tooling and Vault integration timeline.
3. **Deep Dive: API Modularity (35 min)** — Confirm service boundaries, gateway policies, and contract linting.
4. **Deep Dive: Dependency Injection (30 min)** — Select frameworks and codify DI usage guidelines.
5. **Deep Dive: Observability (30 min)** — Approve OpenTelemetry rollout plan and SLO targets.
6. **Break (10 min)**
7. **Risk & Dependency Mapping (20 min)** — Surface blockers and mitigation owners.
8. **Roadmap Alignment (25 min)** — Sync on iteration milestones from migration calendar.
9. **Next Steps & Action Items (10 min)** — Assign owners, due dates, and communication cadences.

## Confirmed Priorities
- GitOps-first configuration with Vault-backed secrets.
- Domain-aligned API microservices with gateway enforcement.
- Standardized DI container usage with testability focus.
- Full-stack observability via OpenTelemetry and Grafana dashboards.
