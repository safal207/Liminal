# Modernization Migration Calendar

## Overview
Migration will run across three iterations of 4â€“6 weeks each, coordinating backend, ML, DevOps, and documentation streams. Each iteration culminates in a cross-functional readiness review.

## Iteration 1 (2025-07-08 to 2025-08-16)
- **Backend:**
  - Complete configuration GitOps pipeline prototype.
  - Deliver service decomposition blueprint and approve API gateway policies.
  - Checkpoint: Architecture review sign-off on config pipeline design (2025-07-29).
- **ML:**
  - Align DI strategy for inference services and implement pilot in model-serving stack.
  - Document data contract expectations for modular APIs.
  - Checkpoint: DI pilot demo with unit tests (2025-08-08).
- **DevOps:**
  - Stand up Vault integration with automated secret rotation.
  - Instrument baseline OpenTelemetry collectors in staging.
  - Checkpoint: Observability stack smoke test (2025-08-13).
- **Documentation:**
  - Publish configuration management playbook.
  - Draft API modularization guide and glossary updates.
  - Checkpoint: Docs review session (2025-08-14).

## Iteration 2 (2025-08-19 to 2025-09-27)
- **Backend:**
  - Implement first two domain microservices behind gateway.
  - Integrate AsyncAPI/OpenAPI linting in CI.
  - Checkpoint: Service contract validation report (2025-09-10).
- **ML:**
  - Extend DI pattern to training pipelines and feature services.
  - Introduce automated model performance telemetry.
  - Checkpoint: ML observability dashboard walkthrough (2025-09-18).
- **DevOps:**
  - Harden telemetry pipelines and define SLO error budgets.
  - Automate environment provisioning with configuration overlays.
  - Checkpoint: SLO acceptance review (2025-09-24).
- **Documentation:**
  - Release DI best practices guide.
  - Update runbooks with observability troubleshooting steps.
  - Checkpoint: Documentation usability test (2025-09-25).

## Iteration 3 (2025-09-30 to 2025-11-08)
- **Backend:**
  - Complete migration of remaining high-traffic endpoints to modular services.
  - Finalize deprecation of legacy configuration paths.
  - Checkpoint: Performance regression test report (2025-10-28).
- **ML:**
  - Operationalize model retraining triggers with new configuration workflows.
  - Validate end-to-end trace coverage for inference and training flows.
  - Checkpoint: ML reliability review (2025-11-05).
- **DevOps:**
  - Expand observability SLIs to production and set up alert on-call rotations.
  - Conduct chaos engineering exercises to validate resiliency.
  - Checkpoint: Production readiness review (2025-11-06).
- **Documentation:**
  - Finalize migration handbook and retrospectives.
  - Archive superseded docs and update knowledge base.
  - Checkpoint: Final editorial QA (2025-11-07).

## Governance
- Bi-weekly steering committee to review progress, risks, and budget.
- Burndown tracked in shared roadmap tool with dependency highlighting.
- Retro at end of each iteration to capture learnings.
